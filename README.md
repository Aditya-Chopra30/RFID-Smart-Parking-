# RFID-Smart-Parking-
RFID is a technology that helps to identify the animate or inanimate through radiowaves. 
This project deals with an effective way of checking into the parking space and easily finding empty parking slots. This system also helps in managing the number of vehicles moving in and out in complex parking structures such as dedicated parking lots/buildings by detecting a vehicle using IR sensors and providing feedback. The fully automated smart car parking system is rudimentary and does not require heavy lines of code nor expensive equipment. It is a simple circuit built for demonstration and to fulfil the exact need of purpose.
The developed system in this project monitors the availability of idle parking slots and guides the vehicle to the nearest such slot.
This system aims at replacing the conventional parking system with an IoT-based smart parking system by using RFID (radio-frequency identification). The users will be provided an entry card for getting access to the parking slot. 
The systems reservation-based parking policy has the potential to smoothen the operations of parking systems, as well as mitigate traffic congestion caused by parking search. As an added advantage it also saves the time required tocheck-in and get slots to park vehicles.
